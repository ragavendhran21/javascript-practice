const longestPalindrome = (s) => {
  if (s.length < 1) return "";

  let start = 0, end = 0;

  const expandFromCenter = (left, right) => {
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
      left--;
      right++;
    }
    return [left + 1, right - 1];
  };

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let [l1, r1] = expandFromCenter(i, i);       // odd length
    let [l2, r2] = expandFromCenter(i, i + 1);   // even length

    if (r1 - l1 > end - start) [start, end] = [l1, r1];
    if (r2 - l2 > end - start) [start, end] = [l2, r2];
  }

  return s.slice(start, end + 1);
};

// Example:
console.log(longestPalindrome("abac")); // Outputs: "aba"
______________________________________________________________________

You are given a list of intervals. Each interval is a pair of numbers [start, end], like [1, 3], which means a segment from 1 to 3.

The task is to merge all overlapping intervals into one.
const mergeIntervals = (intervals) => {
  if (intervals.length <= 1) return intervals;

  // Sort intervals by starting value
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  const result = [intervals[0]];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    let last = result[result.length - 1];
    let current = intervals[i];

    // If intervals overlap, merge them
    if (current[0] <= last[1]) {
      last[1] = Math.max(last[1], current[1]);
    } else {
      result.push(current);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

// Example usage:
const input = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]];
console.log(mergeIntervals(input));  // Output: [ [1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18] ]
